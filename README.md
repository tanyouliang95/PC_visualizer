# Web-based PC visualizer
## Point cloud visualizer

This is a repository for PCV tool. PCV is a web-based point cloud visualizer for the usage of the perception team. The objective of having this tool is to enable the easy access and visualize of the vehicle generated lidar point cloud. Besides, the new database structure and organization will help in providing a much organize database storing structure and update mechanism of all existing tracklets.

The Development kit includes NojeJs, ThreeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS...

This project is fully developed by me and another partner. Due to IP issue, I would only attach a documentation named "README.pdf" in this repos.
